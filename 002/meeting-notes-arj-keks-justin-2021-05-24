handshake between feeds - misunderstanding about being single device,
need to clarify further. Maybe remove some of the examples.

domain separation for main signing messages, look at sign in with ssb

maybe a new incredibly simple feed format for meta feeds?

related, maybe a different identifier, like
%sdfasldkrf;skjdf;laksjdf=.cloaked for private groups versus
@sdfasldkrf;skjdf;laksjdf=.ed25519 for current classic feeds

keks thought it doesn't make sense to make a distinction between index
feeds and claims. They should all just be claims. What happens if you
have a broken implementation that creates broken index feeds?

instead of using timestamp for nonce use random bytes

the query language in
https://github.com/ssb-ngi-pointer/ssb-secure-partial-replication-spec
needs a proper spec. Maybe also a bit more general.

meta feeds spec mentions subfeed-1 at one point, we probably should
use the nonce instead for generating keys as they are unique.

potential date for next meeting 15 June

arj will send updated specs at the end of this week
