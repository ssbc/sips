## Abstract

What is Bendy Butt?

> A new feed format designed for [meta feeds]

Why a new feed format, when we already have [gabby grove] and [bamboo]?

> Because we would want to offer a feed format that is simple and easy
> to implement in any programming language by reusing an established
> format ([bencode]) with existing encoder libraries.  Furthermore, as
> meta feeds makes it easier to have multiple feed formats, we wanted
> to show that creating a new feed format does not have to be hard.

Can't you just use the classic format?

> That would mean clients would have to support reading and writing
> the classic format forever, even for applications that only use
> newer feed formats.

What is wrong with the classic format?

> There are multiple problems, most of them come from the fact that it
> is very tied to the internals of the v8 engine for Javascript. JSON
> is good as an exchange format for values of data but not well suited
> to cryptographically sign messages where a canonical representation
> of each value is paramount.

Can I use Bendy Butt for purposes other than meta feeds?

> Yes, but Bendy Butt was not designed as a general purpose feed
> format. We do not intend to extend Bendy Butt to cover any other
> use cases besides meta feeds, but if the feed format constraints
> are sufficient for your use cases, nothing stops you from using it.
> To preserve the simplicity of this spec, we recommend not sending
> patches to the spec to generalize it.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Notations for bencode and BFE**

To avoid confusion with JSON, we shall use the notation `{ "a" => 1, "b" => 2 }`
to denote a [bencode] *dictionary* with two entries: key "a" mapping to value
`1` and key "b" mapping to value `2`.  We shall use the notation `[a, b, c]` to
denote a [bencode] *list* of three values `a`, `b`, and `c`.

For sequences of bytes, we use the notation `<03 02 01>` to represent the
sequence of bytes `03` followed by `02` followed by `01`. We use the notation
`a + b + c` to denote *byte concatenation* of the byte sequences `a` followed by
`b` followed by `c`. In other words `<05 04> + <03 02 01>` equals
`<05 04 03 02 01>`.

For abstract substitutions, we use `(something)` to denote whatever `something`
describes. In other words, anything wrapped in parentheses is just a placeholder
for something else.

## Specification

A *Bendy Butt message* is encoded in [bencode] as a list of message `payload`
and `signature`, which we shall denote `[payload, signature]`. SSB Binary Field
Encodings ([SSB-BFE]) is used to encode all non-list non-dictionary non-integer
values contained in the `payload` and `signature`. BFE also helps to
disambiguate binary data like feed IDs and message IDs from generic data types
such as strings.

The message `payload` is a bencode list with 5 elements in this specific order,
in other words, `[author, sequence, previous, timestamp, contentSection]`:

1) `author`, a BFE-encoded "feed ID"
2) `sequence`, a [bencode integer] greater than or equal to 1
3) `previous`, a BFE-encoded "message ID" of the previous message
  on the feed. For the first message this must be the BFE "nil" generic data
  type.
4) `timestamp`, a [bencode integer] representing the UNIX epoch timestamp of message
  creation.
5) `contentSection` can be one of two possible shapes:
    1. `[content, contentSignature]` such that `content` is any bencode
    dictionary representing the message contents, all of which are internally
    encoded with BFE; and `contentSignature` is a BFE-encoded "signature". The
    signature is applied on `prefix + content`, where `prefix` is the string
    "bendybutt" encoded as UTF8 bytes. The signature uses some cryptographic
    keypair which **MAY** be different from the `author` keypair (for example,
    under the [meta feeds] spec, this will be the subfeed keypair).
    2. BFE-encoded "encrypted data". Upon decryption, it takes the shape
    `[content, contentSignature]` as described above.

The message `signature` is applied on `payload` using the `author`'s
cryptographic keypair.

Both the `signature` and the `contentSignature` use the same [HMAC signing capability]
(`sodium.crypto_auth`) and `sodium.crypto_sign_detached` as in the classic
SSB format (ed25519).

The key or ID of a Bendy Butt message is the SHA256 hash of the bencoded bytes
for `[payload, signature]`, i.e. `key = SHA256([payload, signature])`.

### Example

Following our `[a, b]` and `{ "a" => 1, "b" => 2}` notation, which may look
similar to JSON, here is a Bendy Butt message with the `content` dictionary
equal to `{ "type" => 'greet', "text" => 'Good morning!' }`.

Notice that is has the shape:

    timestamp,
    [

Here is the same data as above, but displayed in raw binary (hexadecimal):

### Validation

For validation we differentiate between *message validity* and *content
validity*. Since the content can be encrypted, there is potentially no way to
validate that. This means a message should only be rejected before insertion
into the local database if it fails the message validation rules. A message
should not be included in the bendy butt feed if its content is not valid.

The message **MUST** conform to the following rules:

 - Has the shape of a bencode list `[payload, signature]`
 - The payload has the shape of bencode list `[author, sequence, previous, timestamp, contentSection]`
 - The `previous` field matches the previous message's ID
 - The `signature` field must be correctly signing the `payload`
 - The [SSB-BFE] *type-format* for `author` is `0x0003` (there is no
 upgradeability in the middle of a feed)
 - The [SSB-BFE] *type-format* for `previous` is `0x0104`
 - The `author` is the same as in previous messages on the feed
 - The maximum size of a `[payload, signature]` in bytes must not exceed 8192 bytes

Under the Bendy Butt spec, the content is free-form, but under the [meta feeds]
spec there are strict constraints applied to this bencode dictionary.
